# Employee Attendance Module

This is an Odoo-based Employee Attendance System that allows employees to track their check-in and check-out times. The system features a user-friendly interface where employees can easily mark their attendance with a "Check In" and "Check Out" button. It also tracks worked hours and marks attendance status as "Present" or "Absent" based on the check-in/check-out time.

## Features

- **Status Update**: The attendance status is updated to "Present" when the employee checks in.
- **Worked Hours**: Automatically calculates the total worked hours based on the check-in and check-out times.
